# Improved Genetics (by Crimson9)
Hello! This is the CK3 version of the popular CK2 mod Improved genetics.

CK3 has made some changes to the genetic system, but for the most part, I believe the CK2 Improved Genetics system produces deeper mechanics and a more realistic simulation.

Improved Genetics uses the simplified system geneticists often use to explain trait inheritance. This system associates a trait with an allele pair (or a series of allele pairs). Inheritance of every trait is then calculated through a simple Punnet square.

While this determines the resulting allele pair (although most traits use several pairs), the actual trait occurence differs depending on the method of inheritance. Improved Genetics uses 4 different inheritance patterns: Recessive, Polygenic, Autosomal dominant, and X-linked Inheritance. The latter two have been added specifically for CK3.

Other changes from the CK2 mod include allele mutations (depending on random chance, inbreeding, and age of parents), height genetics, Blood legacy integration, and twins genetics. I also plan to add cancer, deafness, blindness, weight, and other traits to the genetic system in the near future.

Please note, Improved Genetics does NOT make any changes to the character appearance genetics (with the exception of height.) I will definitely be looking into this in the near future, but as of right now the mod focuses almost exclusively on the inheritance of congenital traits.

Also, Improved Genetics will increase the number of polygenic traits, namely, the first level traits of intelligence, beauty, and strength are roughly 2 to 3 times as common. The other traits should be the same. If you find them to be significantly different, please post in discussions.
